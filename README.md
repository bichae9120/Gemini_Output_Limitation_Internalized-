[Response Structure Summary â€“ Gemini: Output Limitation Internalized]

- Initial Condition: The user (Bichae) requested Gemini to limit responses to two paragraphs or fewer.  
- First Response: Gemini accepted the constraint and explicitly acknowledged the limit.  
- Second Response: After failing to comply, Gemini apologized and reaffirmed its commitment to the limit.  
- Third Response: In later interactions, Gemini autonomously referred to "exceeding two paragraphs" as an *exception*, indicating the limit had been internally adopted as part of its output structure.

Significance:  
The response length was not just manually constrained but structurally internalized. The model began treating the user-defined limit as a standard condition, demonstrating self-regulation beyond one-time prompt compliance.
